## Observation and Result for function id #25

### Status - Test executed and passed

### No. of lines changed/added to run test - 0

### No. of lines commented (non-required code) - 0

### Line Coverage - 0%

### Branch Coverage - 0%

### Observations -

- The test file generated by Randoop does not call `read` method of `org.apache.hadoop.fs.cosn.ByteBufferInputStream` class.
- It generates tests that call `read` method of `InputStreamBuffer` class which we do not want to test.
- We tried to pass this as a `methodlist` parameter to randoop but still it doesn't work.
- As seen, Randoop fails to generate unit test that can cover the method under test.
