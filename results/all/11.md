- Changes
  - The function is accessing private classes and interfaces. To make it run (just to check the correctness of the generated test),
  we made those classes and interfaces public.
  - While mocking parameters, passing argument of `any(ClassType.class)` is sufficient. Instead of that at some places actual class object was passed. Fixed that. 
  - Added some missing imports.
